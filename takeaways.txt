import A from '.A'
only works when A has the DEFAULT EXPORT.
In this case it doesn't matter what name you assign to it when importing:

import A from './A'
import MyA from './A'
import TheThing from '.A'


Import { A } from './A' is a named import.
It only works if A contains a named export called A:
export const A = 42

In this case the name matters.
